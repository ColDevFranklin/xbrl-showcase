    "debate": "Graham's value investing principles penalize AAPL due to its high price-to-book ratio (52.3x) and relatively high debt-to-equity ratio (1.8). These metrics suggest overvaluation and financial leverage, which conflicts with Graham's preference for undervalued, financially stable companies. However, Buffett's quality investing strategy favors AAPL because it considers the company's strong intangible assets: powerful brand, network effects from its ecosystem, and high switching costs for users. While Graham's approach focuses on tangible book value, Buffett's approach emphasizes the ongoing ability to generate economic profit. In AAPL's case, Buffett sees a company with a durable competitive position that can continue generating high returns (ROE 147%), despite high valuation and debt levels."
